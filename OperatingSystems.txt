Operating Systems

Windows 10
Windows 10 is the most recent iteration of Microsoft’s popular personal computing operating system. It is the successor of 8.1, their last major release. It is the OS that I use on a daily basis and is being run on the computer I am typing this up on.
Advantages
•	Windows has been around for a long time, with over 900 million devices currently running Windows 10, so compatibility issues should not be a problem
•	Stability and performance improvements across the board, and loading time of OS greatly reduced
•	Further integration of universal apps, which can be used with touch screen devices like the Surface and 2-in-1 laptops
•	Windows built-in anti-virus suite Windows Defender has come a long way, with an improved firewall and other features
•	The start menu is back, a feature Windows controversially took out in Windows 8
•	Overall easier to use interface
Disadvantages
•	A couple of applications present in earlier versions are no longer made, and therefore are not bundled into the OS
•	During launch, there was controversy when users investigated the analytics and user-data that the OS logs, although this could be turned off during an advanced installation
•	Older machines could have problems running it
